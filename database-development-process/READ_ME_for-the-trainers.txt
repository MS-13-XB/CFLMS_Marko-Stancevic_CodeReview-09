Dear trainers,

I did the 4 steps of database-developement. 

But I will tell you secretly that i do the step 4 first, and the step 3 and so on.
Because to me it is so easilier.(I did the normalised database and after i took some entites out to have the step 1) :)

I have two 3-steps pictures, one of them is made in draw.io and the second one in MySQL.
I want to notice that a had not so much time to draw it in the draw.io with all the connections. 
So i made a design with only the entities and the relations(tables) without the connections(lines).
After that i created my database and took a scernshot about the whole database(in designer).
